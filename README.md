# üñºÔ∏è AI Object Detection App

Welcome to the **AI Object Detection App**! This is a simple yet powerful web application built with **Vue.js** that enables users to upload images and detect objects within them using a pre-trained machine learning model. The app integrates **TensorFlow.js** and the **COCO-SSD** model to identify and label objects, demonstrating how modern web development can be combined with machine learning.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can easily upload an image from their device to be analyzed.
- **Object Detection**: The application uses the COCO-SSD model to detect various objects within the uploaded image.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and labels directly on the image.
- **Progress Indicator**: A progress bar ensures smooth user experience by displaying the status while the image is being processed.
- **Results Display**: Lists all detected objects with their class names and confidence scores, providing users with detailed information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js, COCO-SSD Model
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
